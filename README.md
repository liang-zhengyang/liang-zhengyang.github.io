- **Support Google analytics**: you can trace the traffics of your homepage by easy configuration.
- **Responsive**: this homepage automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.
- **Beautiful and Simple Design**: this homepage is beautiful and simple, which is very suitable for academic personal homepage.

## Quick Start

1. Fork this REPO and rename to `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` is your github USERNAME.
1. Configure the google scholar citation crawler:
    1. Find your google scholar ID in the url of your google scholar page (e.g., https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SCHOLAR_ID), where `SCHOLAR_ID` is your google scholar ID.
    1. Set `GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID` in `.github/workflows/google_scholar_crawler.yaml` to the same profile as the Scholar URL in `_config.yml`.
    1. Enable the `Update Google Scholar publications and citations` workflow under `Actions`. It writes `gs_data.json` to the `google-scholar-stats` branch daily at 08:00 UTC (16:00 Singapore/Beijing), or manually with `Run workflow`. Pushing changes to the crawler or this workflow on main also triggers a crawl.
    1. This site's workflow is configured for Scholar ID `9IC8FBQAAAAJ`. To change profiles, update both the Scholar URL in `_config.yml` and `GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID` in the workflow. Set the optional Actions secret `SERPAPI_KEY` to use SerpApi; otherwise the crawler uses scholarly.
    1. `google_scholar_publications_auto_update: true` updates matched titles, publication details and citations, adds new Scholar papers, and sorts cards by descending year. Matching uses Scholar IDs before normalized titles. Existing images, full author lists, contribution marks, conference badges and resource links remain curated; new cards use Scholar author/venue metadata and a Scholar details link. Add images and code/project links manually when desired.
    1. Curated cards remain as a static fallback, including unmatched papers. Failed fetches leave them visible. Run the updated workflow successfully once to populate the new list schema; old snapshots still update citations. Set `google_scholar_publications_auto_update: false` to disable list synchronization.
1. Generate favicon using [favicon-generator](https://redketchup.io/favicon-generator) and download all generated files to `REPO/images`.
1. Modify the configuration of your homepage `_config.yml`:
    1. `title`: the title of your homepage
    1. `description`: the description of your homepage
    1. `repository`: USER_NAME/REPO_NAME  
    1. `google_analytics_id` (optional): google analytics ID
    1. SEO Related keys (optional): get these keys from search engine consoles (e.g. Google, Bing and Baidu) and paste here.
    1. `author`: the author information of this homepage, including some other websites, emails, city and univeristy.
    1. More configuration details are described in the comments.
1. Add your homepage content in `_pages/about.md`.
    1. You can use html+markdown syntax just same as jekyll.
    1. You can use a `<span>` tag with class `show_paper_citations` and attribute `data` to display the citations of your paper. Set the data to the google scholar paper ID. For
        ```html
        <span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span>
        ``` 
        > Q: How to get the google scholar paper ID?   
        > A: Enter your google scholar homepage and click the paper name. Then you can see the paper ID from `citation_for_view=XXXX`, where `XXXX` is the required paper ID.
1. Your page will be published at `https://USERNAME.github.io`.

## Debug Locally

1. Clone your REPO to local using `git clone`.
1. Install Jekyll building environment, including `Ruby`, `RubyGems`, `GCC` and `Make` following [the installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements).
1. Run `bash run_server.sh` to start Jekyll livereload server.
1. Open http://127.0.0.1:4000 in your browser.
1. If you change the source code of the website, the livereload server will automatically refresh.
1. When you finish the modification of your homepage, `commit` your changings and `push` to your remote REPO using `git` command.
